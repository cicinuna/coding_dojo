        <p>
            This is a survival game designed for users to find weapons, avoid harmful gas-filled areas that surround more ares of the map as the game progresses, and eventually be the last-man-standing in order to win the game. <br>
            A player is matched against 99 other players, where each player freely drops on any part of the game map within the allowed flight trajectory. <br>
            Not only does one need to be masterful in aiming, one also needs instinctive, yet well-planned actions for choosing which part of the map to conquer or <br>
            which part of the map to wait in order to ambush other players. One can choose a variety of weapons ranging from melee weapons such as machete to powerful sniper rifles <br>
            such as the awm. In the table below, you can find a variety of weapons one can find in the game.
